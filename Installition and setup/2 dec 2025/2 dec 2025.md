### **Short Note – Connecting ADB in VirtualBox Without Bridge Mode**

I learned that I can use ADB from inside a VirtualBox VM without switching to Bridge mode by setting up **NAT Port Forwarding**. In VirtualBox, I shut down the VM, went to *Settings → Network → Adapter 1 (NAT) → Advanced → Port Forwarding*, and added a rule that forwards **host port 5555** to the VM’s **10.0.2.15:5555**.

After starting the VM again, I simply used:

```
adb connect 127.0.0.1:5555
```

This let the VM communicate with my Android device through ADB even while staying on the default NAT network.



### **Problems I Faced When Using Bridge Mode in VirtualBox**

When I tried using Bridge mode, I ran into a few issues that made it frustrating to work with. The biggest problem was that the university Wi-Fi kept treating my VM like a new device, asking me to sign in again every time. Since the network has device limits and authentication rules, the VM wouldn’t always get internet access. Sometimes the VM wouldn’t receive an IP at all, or the connection would drop randomly because the Wi-Fi didn’t allow virtual MAC addresses. These issues made Bridge mode unreliable, especially on campus networks that have strict login systems.

### Pushing files

commands:
- adb push test.txt /sdcard/
- adb -s emulator-5554 push test.txt /sdcard/


### Pulling the files

command :

- `adb pull /sdcard/make.png ./`

### ADB Root

```shell 
ayush@ayush-83eq:~$ adb root
restarting adbd as root
ayush@ayush-83eq:~$ adb shell
emu64xa:/ # 
```
- Dose not work with real devices any more.

Here’s a polished version of your note:

### **ADB Reverse**

* I’m running a local server serving `index.html` at `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`. Using command `python3 -m http.server`
* To access this server from the emulator, I set up a reverse port forwarding:

```bash
ayush@ayush-83eq:~$ adb reverse tcp:1234 tcp:8000
1234
```

* Now the emulator can access the host server via **localhost:1234**.
