### **Short Note – Connecting ADB in VirtualBox Without Bridge Mode**

I learned that I can use ADB from inside a VirtualBox VM without switching to Bridge mode by setting up **NAT Port Forwarding**. In VirtualBox, I shut down the VM, went to *Settings → Network → Adapter 1 (NAT) → Advanced → Port Forwarding*, and added a rule that forwards **host port 5555** to the VM’s **10.0.2.15:5555**.

After starting the VM again, I simply used:

```
adb connect 127.0.0.1:5555
```

This let the VM communicate with my Android device through ADB even while staying on the default NAT network.
