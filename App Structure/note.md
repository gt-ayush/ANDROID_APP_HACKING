### Unziping the apk

command: 
- unzip <File\> -d <Folder\>

**DEX and ODEX in Android (Short Note)**

**DEX (Dalvik Executable):**
DEX is the compiled bytecode format used by Android. Java/Kotlin source code is first compiled into `.class` files, then converted into a single or multiple `.dex` files using the D8/R8 tool. These `.dex` files are optimized for low memory usage and are executed by the Android Runtime (ART). Every APK contains DEX files.

**ODEX (Optimized Dalvik Executable):**
ODEX is an optimized version of DEX, usually generated by the system for **pre-installed (system) apps**. In ODEX, some parts of the app are pre-compiled and stored outside the APK (in `/system/framework` or `/system/app`). This helps the device boot faster and reduces runtime optimization during first launch.

**Key Differences:**

* DEX → Inside APK, used by all apps
* ODEX → Outside APK, mainly for system apps
* DEX → Compiled at install/run time
* ODEX → Pre-optimized for faster boot and performance

**Modern Android Note:**
From Android 5.0 (ART) onward, the system mainly uses **AOT (Ahead-of-Time)** and **JIT compilation**, so traditional ODEX usage is less visible, but the concept of pre-optimization still exists.

### GHex (Short Note)

**GHex is a hexadecimal editor used mainly on Linux systems.** It allows users to view, edit, and analyze files at the byte (hex) level, which is useful for low-level debugging, reverse engineering, and file inspection.

- `sudo apt-get install ghex`
- `ghex classes.dex `

**dexdump (Short Note)**

**dexdump** is a **command-line tool** provided in the **Android SDK** that is used to **analyze DEX (Dalvik Executable) files**. It prints the internal structure of a `.dex` file in a **human-readable format**.

**Key Points:**

* Displays **classes, methods, fields, strings, and bytecode**
* Used for **reverse engineering and debugging**
* Helps understand how an APK is structured internally
* Works on **classes.dex** files extracted from APKs
* Output can be shown in **brief or detailed** form

**Example Use:**

```bash
dexdump classes.dex
```

**Common Uses:**

* Studying compiled Android apps
* Verifying DEX content after build or modification
* Analyzing suspicious or malware APKs

**Note:**
`dexdump` **does not modify** files—it is strictly an **inspection tool**.


**ADB & APK Tools – Short Notes**

**1. `adb shell`**
Used to open a **remote Linux shell** on a connected Android device or emulator. It allows direct interaction with the Android system.

* Used for debugging, file access, and system commands
* Example: `adb shell ls /system/app`

**2. `pm list packages`**
A **Package Manager (pm)** command used inside `adb shell` to list installed apps.

* Lists all installed package names
* Options:

  * `pm list packages -s` → system apps
  * `pm list packages -3` → user apps

**3. `pm path <package_name>`**
Displays the **APK file path** of a specific installed application.

* Helps locate where the APK is stored
* Example: `pm path com.android.settings`

**4. `adb pull`**
Used to **copy files from Android device to PC**.

* Commonly used to extract APKs or logs
* Example:

  ```bash
  adb pull /data/app/com.example.apk
  ```

**5. APKTool**
A **reverse-engineering tool** for Android APKs.

* Decodes resources (`XML`, `Manifest`) into readable form
* Rebuilds APK after modification
* Commonly used in **app modding and security analysis**

**Typical Workflow Example:**
`adb shell` → `pm list packages` → `pm path` → `adb pull` → analyze with **APKTool**
