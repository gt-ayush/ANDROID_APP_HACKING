**DEX and ODEX in Android (Short Note)**

**DEX (Dalvik Executable):**
DEX is the compiled bytecode format used by Android. Java/Kotlin source code is first compiled into `.class` files, then converted into a single or multiple `.dex` files using the D8/R8 tool. These `.dex` files are optimized for low memory usage and are executed by the Android Runtime (ART). Every APK contains DEX files.

**ODEX (Optimized Dalvik Executable):**
ODEX is an optimized version of DEX, usually generated by the system for **pre-installed (system) apps**. In ODEX, some parts of the app are pre-compiled and stored outside the APK (in `/system/framework` or `/system/app`). This helps the device boot faster and reduces runtime optimization during first launch.

**Key Differences:**

* DEX → Inside APK, used by all apps
* ODEX → Outside APK, mainly for system apps
* DEX → Compiled at install/run time
* ODEX → Pre-optimized for faster boot and performance

**Modern Android Note:**
From Android 5.0 (ART) onward, the system mainly uses **AOT (Ahead-of-Time)** and **JIT compilation**, so traditional ODEX usage is less visible, but the concept of pre-optimization still exists.
